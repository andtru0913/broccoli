In the time report system, you report your worked time and it should be submitted regularly, on a
weekly basis (unless otherwise stated, for example, at the end of the month, when the time reports
may be required, report can be submitted in the middle of a week).
You select project in the box above "Lägg till kod" (add identification key), fill in your hours,
click on "Uppdatera" (update) and then "Rapportera" (report).
The time report system contains a detailed manual with pictures on how to fill in your worked
time and how to change a password.

## Flexible working hours

BBroccoli offers the employees flexible working hours within certain limits (see below). In order
for this to work, there must be an open discussion with the colleagues on their respective
assignments. Deviant regulations at each assignment may apply.

* Flex frame in the morning: 05.00-09.00
* Flex frame in the afternoon: 15.00-21.00

In the flex time bank, you can have a maximum of +80 hours or -40 hours. You can choose to
take out hours in free time or money, factor 1: 1 applies in both cases. Time within the flex frame
is not seen as inconvenient working hours. If you choose to take the hours as free time you have
to ask so that it works with the assignment. The core time is 09.00-15.00, which means that you
should be at work during this period of time, unless otherwise agreed.
During the time between two assignments, you are not allowed to increase your time bank. On
the contrary, it is good if you may decrease the time bank in the case it has a positive balance.
Don’t miss to appreciate the decreased pace between assignments.


## Grids and breaks

**Generally**

At lunch break and other breaks, you have to adhere to what applies at the current assignment.

**Lunch break**

The lunch break is usually 40-60 min depending on the assignment.

**Breaks**

Breaks, other than lunch, are paid working hours, which means that you may not leave the
workplace during the break because certain circumstances may occur and the break must be
interrupted.
