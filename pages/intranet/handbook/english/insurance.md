# Tjänstepension
Savings for occupational pension is administered by Collectum and follows ITP1. [www.collectum.se/](https://www.collectum.se/)

## Löneväxling
Broccoli offers employees the opportunity to change part of their salary in favour of extra
pension.
- A salary exchange is possible for a gross salary that exceeds 8.07 price base amount per
year after the salary exchange. It is not recommended to exchange salaries at lower
salaries as the general pension and other social insurance benefits then decreases.
- The minimum amount for salary exchange is SEK 1,000 per month. The chosen amount is
to be incremented by SEK 500.
- When signing up for a salary exchange, you can opt for repayment protection. This
means that your relatives (spouse, cohabitant, children) are entitled to your pension
money if you were to decease prior to the age of 65.
- If the employee chooses to make a salary waiver, the company undertakes to take out an
occupational pension insurance with an amount corresponding to the salary waiver
calculated by a factor of 1.358 of the deduction. This is to compensate for the reduced
premium to ITP 1 (collective agreement) and due to the difference between special
payroll tax and the employer's contribution (5.8%).
- Salary change for pension savings in collaboration with Söderberg & Partners.

For more detailed information about salary exchanges, read more on our Intranet. If you have
questions or want a personal meeting to discuss the possibilities, contact HR or consultant
responsible who mediates the contact with Söderberg & Partners.
