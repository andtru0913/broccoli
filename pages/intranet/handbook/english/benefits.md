# Broccoli phone
Because each consultant needs to be reachable through phone Broccoli offers every employee
the benefit of a phone and a phone plan. The subsidy for phones covers 8500kr + sales tax and
can be renewed every two years. The demand is for the employee to be accessible on said phone
during work hours.
- Alternatively, you offer your private mobile number in case you don’t want two phones
- Important that you’re accessible on the number listed since Broccoli is paying for it.
## Health care
### Wellness allowance
Broccoli offers its employees a wellness allowance of 4000kr per person and fiscal year (0901-

allowances.

include: gym membership, swimming pool membership, sports clubs memberships, dance
