VIn case of illness or VAB (Care of sick children), both Broccoli and the nearest manager must be
informed. Sick leave is to be informed on the first sick day, and on the first day back to work.
Broccoli should be notified by email: [admin@broccoli.se](mailto:admin@broccoli.se).

From the 8th calendar day, employees have to submit a medical certificate / medical report to
Broccoli, which confirms that the workforce is reduced. A copy of the medical certificate is
sufficient.
- The first 14 days of sick leave are compensated by the employer. Thereafter the liability
goes to the insurance fund, which means that the employee himself has to apply to the
insurance fund.
- For illness on days 15-90, a supplemental compensation from Broccoli is added. This is
regulated by the collective agreement.

- Broccoli has health insurance through collective agreements that compensate for loss of
income for long-term sick leave.
- Medical certificates can be requested from the first day if the employer has good reasons
for this. Broccoli has the policy to request medical certificates on the first day of sickness,
from the 11th illness day during a 12-months rolling period. In connection with this we
also have a rehabilitation dialogue with the employee
