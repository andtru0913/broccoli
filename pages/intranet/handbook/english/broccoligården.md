# Broccolig책rden
Broccolig책rden is a place for us at Broccoli to gather, come off-site but it is also a staff benefit to
be able to use as a private person with family and friends.
It is an old hostel / children's camp located on Orust just outside Svanesund. There are almost 40
beds, a large common kitchen, living room that can be used for conferences and a large lovely
terrace. Broccolig책rden is located on a beach plot with rocks, forest and a large garden.
It is possible to visit the farm as:
- Private person with family and friends
- Employed at work together with working group
- One of our customers
- External company / association with connection to one of Broccoli's employees
  Broccolig책rden is adapted to be used for day conferences, conferences with overnight stays and
  recreation for non-work occasions.
  More information about availability, booking, price, etc. can be found on the Intranet or contact
