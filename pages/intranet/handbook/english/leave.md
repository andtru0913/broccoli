the holiday year runs from 1 April to one year until 31
March of the following year. The statutory holiday entitlement based on section 4 of the same
law, allows up to 25 vacation days per year. Vacancy is completely independent of whether the
days are paid or unpaid.

## Advance vacation
In case of new employment, 20 vacation days are provided in advance. The days are then
counted off with a 5th part per year, during 5 years period. Should you terminate your
employment before and have taken advantage of the advance vacation days, you will be liable for
the expenses of the refunded days which were not uncounted.


## Vacation carry over
According to the Vacation Act, workers who have more than twenty holiday pay days in one
vacation period are allowed to save the surplus days for next vacation period if desired.

## Withdrawal of vacation
How the vacation is planned and taken out is individual for the respective assignments. You
apply for vacation with your manager at the assignment but also with your consultant
responsible or CEO at Broccoli. However, as soon as the holiday is approved, notify us via email [admin@broccoli.se](mailto:admin@broccoli.se).

## Parental leave
According to the [Parental Leave Act (1995:584)](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/foraldraledighetslag-1995584_sfs-1995-584)
full leave for a parent applies until the child
has reached 18 months or, given that the parent has full parental allowance, for a period
thereafter (full leave with or without parental allowance).

According to the same law, a parent is entitled to a shortening of normal working hours by up to
25% for the care of a child who has not reached the age of eight or is older but has not yet
completed his first school year.

Employees who wish to exercise their parental leave must notify the employer at least two
months in advance. The employee must also indicate how long the leave will last.

Parental leave may be divided up to a maximum of three periods for each calendar year. If a
period of unemployment exceeds one-year change, it shall be deemed to belong to the calendar
year when unemployment commenced.

## Parental wage
In case of parental leave, compensation is paid to compensate for loss of income. This benefit is
included in the collective agreement. For more information, see the collective agreement
document

## Leave of absense
At the time of leave, no salary is paid. Service leave is therefore not holiday-based.

## Funeral
